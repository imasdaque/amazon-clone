Welcome to my Amazon Clone project! This repository houses a dynamic and visually appealing website that closely emulates the renowned Amazon e-commerce platform. Built entirely using HTML and CSS, this project showcases my web development skills and attention to detail in replicating Amazon's user interface.

**Key Features:**
- **Responsive Design:** The Amazon Clone is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

- **Product Listings:** Explore a range of products presented in a grid layout similar to Amazon's product pages. Each listing is accompanied by product images, titles, prices, and user ratings.

- **Navigation Bar:** Just like the real Amazon website, this clone features a top navigation bar that includes links to different sections of the site, such as Home, Products, Cart, and Account.

- **Product Details:** Clicking on a product leads you to its dedicated details page, providing more information about the item. This page includes a larger product image, detailed description, customer reviews, and an "Add to Cart" button.
